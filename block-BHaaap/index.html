                integrating Salesforce with external systems through REST APIs.

At CVS Health, I improved system query efficiency by 25% and leveraged Einstein Analytics to boost predictive accuracy by 18%. I’ve also worked on CPQ solutions that reduced quote generation time by 15%. Beyond technical skills, I’m experienced in Agile methodologies and DevOps practices using Salesforce DX and CI/CD pipelines.

I’m passionate about solving complex business problems and constantly improving system performance. I’m excited about this opportunity because it aligns perfectly with my skills and offers a chance to contribute to innovative Salesforce solutions
